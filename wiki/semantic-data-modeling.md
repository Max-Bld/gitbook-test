# Semantic Data Modeling

## Definition

Semantic data modeling can be defined as the development of descriptions and representations of data in such a way that the latterâ€™s meaning is explicit, accurate, and commonly understood by both humans and computer systems.

## Description

One reason why an organization would want to invest in a semantic data model is to enhance the functionality of its AI and data science applications and services. Even though such applications nowadays are (rightly) based on machine learning and statistical techniques, there are several tasks for which having access to explicit symbolic knowledge can be necessary and beneficial.

Another important reason organizations would want a semantic model is to standardize and align the meaning of typically heterogeneous and managed-in-silos data, provide it with context, and make it more discoverable, interoperable, and usable for analytics and other purposes.
