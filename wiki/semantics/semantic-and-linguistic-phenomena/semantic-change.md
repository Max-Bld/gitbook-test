# Semantic Change

## Definition

Semantic change, also known as _semantic drift_, is the phenomenon where a termâ€™s meaning and usage change over time, often in such a way that its new meaning is radically different than the initial one.

## Description

For example, the term awful was originally used to refer to something that inspired awe, admiration, or wonder, rather than its definition nowadays as something exceptionally bad or displeasing for which we use it nowadays.
