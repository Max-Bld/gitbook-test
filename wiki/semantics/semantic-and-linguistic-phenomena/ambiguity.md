# Ambiguity

Definition

Ambiguity is the situation that arises when a piece of information can be interpreted in more than one plausible way.

Description

For example, if I told you that “I was born in Tripoli,” and you knew nothing else about me, then you could not possibly determine whether “Tripoli” refers to the capital of Libya, the city of Tripoli in Lebanon, or the capital of Arcadia in Greece.
