# Uncertainty

## Definition

In natural language, uncertainty is the phenomenon in which a statement’s truth cannot be determined due to complete or partial lack of required knowledge.

## Description

For example, if I say “It’s probably raining right now in Stockholm,” then I am referring to a fact that I’m not sure is actually happening right now.

In a semantic model, uncertainty can be manifested in two ways: an explicit one and an implicit one. Explicit uncertainty is when the statement contains keywords like probably, might, perhaps, apparently, etc., that clearly communicate the lack of abso‐ lute certainty. On the other hand, a statement is implicitly uncertain when it is expressed in a certain way, yet we have reasons to still doubt its truth.
