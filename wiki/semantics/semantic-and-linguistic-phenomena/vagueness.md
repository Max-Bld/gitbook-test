# Vagueness

## Description

The best way to understand the phenomenon of vagueness is through the Sorites Par‐ adox, an ancient puzzle that can be expressed in the form of the following argument:&#x20;

* 1 grain of wheat does not make a heap.&#x20;
* If 1 grain doesn’t make a heap, then 2 grains don’t.&#x20;
* If 2 grains don’t make a heap, then 3 grains don’t.&#x20;
* ...
* If 999,999 grains don’t make a heap, then 1 million grains don’t.
* &#x20;Therefore, 1 million grains don’t make a heap!
