# Entity

## Definition

An entity is something that may exist concretely or abstractly, outside or within our mind.

## Description

An entity is concrete when it has a physical manifestation by which it can be sensed and identified. A particular person, organization, document, or event are all examples of concrete entities. In philosophy and metaphysics, concrete entities are known as particulars and their key characteristic is that they can exist over time but they can only be in one place at a time, i.e., they are “nonrepeatable” entities. Linguistically, concrete entities are usually described via proper nouns.

An abstract entity, on the other hand, does not exist in a particular time or place, but rather as an idea, category, or concept. For example, the concept of Person as “a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness” \[26] is abstract, while you and me as particular persons are concrete. Similarly, a film genre like Film Noir, a field of science like Biology, or a sport like Soccer are all examples of abstract entities. Table 2-1 juxtaposes examples of concrete and abstract entities in different domains.
