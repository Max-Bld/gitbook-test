# Class

## Definition

Classes are abstract entities that represent kinds of things in the world that may serve as semantic types of other entities, concrete or abstract.

## Description

For example, the entity Song can be used as a type of the entity Stairway to Heaven and the entity Team Sport as the type of the entity Basketball. Equivalently, we say that Stairway to Heaven is an instance of the class Song, and Basketball an instance of the class Team Sport.
