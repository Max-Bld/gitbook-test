# Attribute

## Definition

An entity attribute is used to represent a characteristic of an entity that we cannot (or choose not to) represent as a relation with another entity, and instead we use literal values (i.e., numbers, strings, dates, etc.).&#x20;

## Description

We usually use an attribute to represent:

* Characteristics with values that donâ€™t make much sense as distinct entities (e.g., age, height, weight, salary, etc.)
* Characteristics not really related to the domain but useful for administration or other purposes (e.g., the person who added the entity in the model or the method used for its discovery)
