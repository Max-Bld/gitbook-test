# Relation

## Definition

A relation expresses a particular way that two or more [entities](entity.md) can be related to one another.

## Description

For example, the entity Lionel Messi can be related to the entity soccer via the relation plays, as well as via the relation likes (assuming Messi actually likes soccer). These are both binary relations in the sense that they link exactly two entities. If, however, we say that “Lionel Messi married Antonella Roccuzzo in Argentina,” then we have a ternary relation as there are three related entities.\*

Relations are important modeling elements that contribute to the explicitness and [machine-interpretability](../../machine-readability.md) of the meaning of entities by describing characteristics of them and providing knowledge and context that could be used for reasoning. An isolated entity that is not linked to any other entities can be (usually)[ human interpretable](../../human-readability.md) through its name and some natural language definition, yet for a machine none of these elements are directly usable.
