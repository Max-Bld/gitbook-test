# Semantic Registry

Also known as semantic hub, a semantic registry is a platform for organisations to discover and connect with models from other organisations. It promotes interoperability and collaboration by providing a centralised hub for semantic specifications.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Registry is not to serve as a repository. A repository hosts the specifications and makes them available for download from the repository itself. The Registry on the other hand will host the specifications by providing their metadata.&#x20;

Essentially, the metadata on different semantic specifications from the various national repositories and portals is aggregated in one centralised location without duplicating the models themselves. This makes the models findable with a necessary minimum number of metadata by which the user can refine their search.&#x20;

In the end the user will be redirected to the national repositories and portals, where the specifications themselves can be downloaded. This approach increases discoverability while avoiding duplication.
