# Semantic Interoperability

## Definition

The European Interoperability Framework \[EIF] defines semantic interoperability as the ability of organisations to process information from external sources in a meaningful manner. It ensures that the precise meaning of exchanged information is understood and preserved throughout exchanges between parties.&#x20;

According to EIF, semantic interoperability encompasses semantic and syntactic aspects. Semantic interoperability is referred to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them. It entails developing a [vocabulary](core-vocabulary.md) to describe data exchanges, and ensures that the data elements are understood in the same way by communicating receivers. On the other hand, syntactic interoperability is about describing the exact format of the information to be exchanged in terms of grammar, format and schemas.
