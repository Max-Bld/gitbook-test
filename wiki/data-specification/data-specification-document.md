# Data Specification Document



## Definition

A _**data specification document**_, also referred to as _**specification document**_, is the human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape, or a combination of both.

## Description

A data specification document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to understand (a) how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain, and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose. It is to serve as technical documentation for anyone interested in using (e.g. adopting or extending) a semantic data specification (see \[[What is a semantic data specification?](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/terminological-clarifications.html#sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification)]). We assume that the data specification documents are published in HTML format (optionally, others). See, for example, the Core Person specification \[[cpv](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/references.html#ref:cpv)] or the CPSV-AP specification \[[cpsv-ap](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/references.html#ref:cpsv-ap)].
