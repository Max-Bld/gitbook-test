# Data Specification Artefact

## Definition

A _**data specification artefact**_, often referred to as _**specification artefact**_ or simply _**artefact**_, is a materialisation of a semantic data specification in a concrete representation that is appropriate for addressing one or more concerns (e.g. use cases, requirements).

## Description

In the SEMIC context, we consider the following artefact types as primary: ontologies, data shapes, and specification documents. For a description of various concerns addressed in the SEMIC context, please see the section \[[Separation of concerns in SEMIC](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:separation-of-concerns-and-transformation)].

Additionally, we are concerned with syntax bindings and serialisation formats (XML/XSD and JSON-LD in particular). Still, these are not in the scope of this document and are addressed elsewhere. For more, see section on \[[Data specification and artefact types](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:data-specification-and-artefact-types)].
