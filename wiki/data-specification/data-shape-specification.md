# Data Shape Specification



## Definition

A _**data shape specification**_, also referred to as _**data shape constraint specification**_, or simply as _**data shape constraint**_ or _**data shape**_, provides a set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated.

## Description

The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language.

This document will refer to data shape constraint specifications simply as "data shapes", but occasionally also as "data shape constraints" or "data shape specifications".
